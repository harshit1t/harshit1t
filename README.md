### Turning ideas into fast, reliable software.

<b>Impact > Lines of code</b><br/>
I obsess over DX (developer experience), performance budgets, and eliminating flaky processes.

### 🚀 Snapshot

| Metric | Highlight |
| ------ | --------- |
| ⏱ Performance | Lighthouse 95+ targets (Web) |
| ✅ Quality | 90%+ meaningful test coverage (mutation aware) |
| ⚙️ Automation | CI pipelines < 4 min avg runtime |
| 📦 Reuse | Internal npm/pip packages for shared logic |

### 🎮 Fun: Terminal Snake & Contribution Snake

Below is a mini browser Snake game I built (see `snake-game/`). Try it locally or host on GitHub Pages.

Contribution activity snake (auto-updated):

![GitHub Contribution Snake](./dist/contribution-snake.svg)

> The workflow generates an animated snake that eats your contribution graph daily & pushes to `dist/`.

### 📂 Repo Structure

```
├── README.md                # This profile / showcase file
├── LICENSE                  # License (MIT)
├── snake-game/              # Standalone HTML5 Snake game
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── snake.yml            # GitHub Actions: generate contribution snake SVG
└── dist/                    # Auto-generated assets (git-tracked after first run)
```

---

### 🛠 Setup: Contribution Graph Snake

1. Ensure this repository name matches your GitHub username exactly (for a profile README).
2. Enable Actions (first run may require approval).
3. Push once; the scheduled workflow will create `dist/contribution-snake.svg`.

Manual trigger: Go to Actions → Snake → Run workflow.

### 🌟 Philosophy

I care about:
* Frictionless onboarding (single script bootstrap)
* Deterministic builds & reproducible environments
* Small, composable abstractions over frameworks
* Observability-first mindset (logs → traces → metrics)
* Automating away category-of-bugs, not just patches

### 🔥 Featured Micro Highlights

| Area | Example | What Matters |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ |
| DX | Project template generator | 90s to scaffold production-ready repo |
| Perf | Reduced TTFB 40% | Caching + query shaping + gzip/brotli |
| Testing | Contract test harness | Prevented breaking API changes pre-merge |
| CI | Parallel matrix + cache | Cut pipeline 11m → 3m48s |

#### Profile README Tips (Why this stands out)
* Clear value proposition in first screen.
* Dynamic visual (snake) for subtle motion without distraction.
* Metrics framed as outcomes, not buzzword lists.
* Fun project (Snake) shows frontend + game loop logic concisely.
* Philosophy section signals engineering maturity.

Customize: Replace highlight metrics with your actual achievements; keep them truthful & outcome-driven.
